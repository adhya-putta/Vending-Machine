This project implements a Vending Machine application using Python's object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. The application models a real-world vending machine, allowing users to interact with it by selecting products, inserting money, and receiving change. The code utilizes classes and methods to organize and manage different functionalities, such as tracking available products, handling transactions, and updating inventory. The goal was to demonstrate OOP concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism while providing a practical, functional example of a vending machine system.
